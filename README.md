Automating thousands of Excel spreadsheets in under a second. Awesome.

The Python Package Index (PyPi) is the default, vast software repository of open-source Python packages supplied by the Worldwide community of Python developers.

From Pypi we utilize Openpyxl - an excellent package for working with excel spreadsheets. This library read/writes Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files.

This incredible, dynamic Python program can be built in less than 30 minutes.
