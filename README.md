# Automated-Workbook

In this Project, we automate thousands of Excel spreadsheets in under a second. Awesome.

The Python Package Index (PyPi) is the default, vast software repository of open-source Python packages supplied by the Worldwide community of Python developers. PyPi contains over 550 000 Python packages, currently requiring 10 TB of storage.

From Pypi we utilize Openpyxl - an excellent package for working with excel spreadsheets. This library read/writes Excel xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files.

Security: By default openpyxl does not guard against quadratic blowup or billion laughs xml attacks. To guard against these attacks install defusedxml. (Setup.py helps create a distribution package to upload an App or entire project to Pypi.)

The incredible, dynamic Python program we create here can be built in less than 30 minutes.
